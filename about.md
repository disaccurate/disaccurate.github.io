Tinkering with my toys as a child led me to work on hands on projects as a high schooler, eventually leading me to my current studies in Mechanical Engineering at The Cooper Union in NYC. Through coursework and summer experiences, I have gained much interest in the field of aerospace engineering, especially in simulation and modeling.
