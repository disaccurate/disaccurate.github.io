title: Diffuser Design for Fluid Mechanics
---

One of our recent assignments was to design a lifting diffuser designed to lift business cards using fluid mechanics concepts. The input to the diffuser is a positive pressure at about 20mm H2O, which results in a positive velocity into the diffuser. The diffser works by redirecting the air from vertical velocity to horizontal velocity across the bottom surface of the diffuser. This horizontal high velocity region then results in a low pressure region which has a pressure lower than that of atmospheric, which then has a lifting force.

Additionally, there is another concept called entrainment going on here.
